    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Hi, I’m Tanu.</p>
    <p>StoryGrid is my corner of the internet where I share short, meaningful stories across different genres. 
        Each post is crafted to be quick to read but hard to forget.
    </p>

    <p>Stories have a way of reaching places facts and figures can’t. They inspire, heal, and spark conversations that linger long after the last line. A single paragraph can transport us to another world, remind us of who we are, or show us who we could be. Through StoryGrid, I aim to create these small moments of connection — words that meet imagination, and journeys that stay with you.</p>
